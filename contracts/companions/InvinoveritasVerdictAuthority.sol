/// @title  Invinoveritas verdict acceptance authority — a judgment-execution attestation
///         companion for ERC-9999 (TASK-KERNEL v3.0).
/// @notice Occupies the acceptanceAuthorityOf slot for a task token. Does not itself decide
///         whether work is good — it relays a signed, independently-recomputable verdict from
///         invinoveritas's /review verification layer into a kernel ruling, binding that
///         verdict cryptographically to the exact submission (taskVersion + resultHash) it
///         answers, and enforcing an internal decision deadline strictly shorter than the
///         tender's own `judgmentWindow`, per this ERC's "Composing an external judging
///         contract's own timeout" rule in Security Considerations.
///
///         The kernel-side composition this relies on, unchanged: this contract IS the
///         acceptance authority (calls acceptFulfillment/rejectFulfillment only when its own
///         checks pass, so the kernel needs no modification and an indexer sees ordinary judged
///         settlement); it reads `submissionOf(...).taskVersion` off the kernel itself, so it
///         always knows exactly which committed criteria bytes a verdict answers to without
///         being told twice; and it holds its own deadline strictly inside `judgmentWindow`, so
///         a verdict that never arrives resolves the same way any other judge's silence does —
///         the fulfiller claims via `claimUnjudged` on the kernel, not through this contract.
///         Precision, not overclaim (real gap named on t/29597#14, confirmed against the kernel
///         source directly before writing this): under epoch pacing, "resolves" can mean
///         "resolves once `claimUnjudged`'s own epoch-exhaustion check next clears," not
///         instantly the moment `judgmentWindow` closes — this contract inherits that timing
///         exactly as any other silent judge would, it does not add or remove delay of its own.
///
/// @dev HONEST TWO-LAYER TRUST MODEL — stated explicitly rather than overclaimed, matching the
///      account's own REPRODUCED-vs-VERIFIED discipline (WYRIWE):
///
///      LAYER 1, fully trustless, enforced HERE on-chain, no trust in the relayer for either
///      check:
///        (a) BINDING — a relayed verdict must cite the exact `taskVersion` and `resultHash`
///            `submissionOf` currently returns for that submission. A verdict computed against
///            a different version or a different deliverable is refused, not silently accepted.
///        (b) DEADLINE — a verdict arriving after `internalWindow` (configured strictly shorter
///            than the tender's `judgmentWindow` at deployment) is refused, never accepted late.
///            The fulfiller's protection is the kernel's own `claimUnjudged`, exactly as if no
///            acceptance authority existed at all — this contract failing open into silence
///            costs it nothing extra to guard against, by design. Under epoch pacing that
///            protection can itself be queued to the next epoch (the kernel's own documented
///            behavior, not something this contract changes) — worth knowing, not a defect here.
///
///      LAYER 2, off-chain-verified today, on-chain-recomputable by anyone: the verdict's own
///      AUTHENTICITY — that invinoveritas actually signed this exact
///      (decisionRef, policyCommitment, artifactHash) triple — is a BIP-340 schnorr signature
///      over a Nostr kind-30078 event, verified off-chain (by the relayer, and independently by
///      anyone else) against invinoveritas's published pubkey via the free, no-auth
///      /verify-proof endpoint, NOT verified inside this contract. Full on-chain BIP-340
///      verification against that exact curve is real, disclosed future work — not silently
///      assumed done. What this contract guarantees on-chain regardless: the complete verdict
///      payload (decisionRef, policyCommitment, artifactHash, and the raw signature bytes) is
///      emitted verbatim in `VerdictRelayed`, immutably, before the ruling call — so the
///      authenticity check layer 2 depends on is never something only the relayer could ever
///      redo. "The judge said yes, and anyone can recompute why" holds without trusting this
///      contract's relayer or invinoveritas itself for the recompute step — only for the initial
///      relay. Removing that remaining trust step (relayer-submits) is exactly the natural
///      companion work this contract's own docstring names as a v2 direction: on-chain BIP-340
///      verification would let `relayVerdict` become fully permissionless.
